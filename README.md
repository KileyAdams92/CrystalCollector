# week-4-game

The purpose of this game was to create a guessing game that allows the user to “guess” by clicking crystals that are assigned random variables. The user’s goal is to guess the exact same number as the randomly assigned target number(Number to Guess). Users are able to track their wins and losses through multiple games, however if they decide they want to start over with 0 wins and losses, they can click reset which will reset the number to guess, the randomly assigned variables, the counter, the wins, and losses. The crystal variables and target number reset randomly each time a person loses or wins. 

A few of the most challenging aspects in creating this game were creating the randomization for target number and randomNumb. Also, it was challenging to modify the code in order to reset the wins/losses with the reset button. I eventually used a function called logging to create the variables and log the variables in the html. I was able to call the logging function in the resetButton function, and the if/else if statements.
